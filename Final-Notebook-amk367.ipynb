    "    I want to begin with disclaimers/flaws in this method. The main thing that is overlooked in my analysis of crime is the type of crime reported. Because looking at crime is essentially the method to find out the safest neighborhood, crimes such as \"public drunkness' would not necessarily make a neighborhood less safe. However, I did a quick scan of the crimes reported and the cases that we would want to ignore when considering saftey appeared negligible in numbers compared to the dangerous and harfmful crime. The other flaw would simply be that this is an estimate based off of a population reported 3 years ago and some minor rounding in calculations, but I still think it holds mostly true a few years later. \n",

    "    After analyzing the crime rates per captia, you can see Squirell Hill North has the lowest rate at 1 report for every 593 people. I think it is necessary to consider population when looking at crime rates becuase crime rates alone dont give you the full picture. For instance, in the last 30 days, South Shore reported 9 instances of crime which is less than half of Squirell Hill's 20. However, South Shore only reported 29 people on the 2020 concencus, resulting in a crime per every 3 people. Thus, even though Squirell Hill reported more crime as a neighborhood, you are far less likely to come close to it if you were to live here due to a much larger population presence in the neighborhood. This makes Squirrel Hill the best neighborhood to live in in accordance with safety."
